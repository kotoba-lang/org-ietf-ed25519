(ns ed25519.edwards
  "The twisted Edwards curve Ed25519 is defined over, in extended coordinates.

  `-x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d*x^2*y^2` over GF(2^255-19) -- the same field X25519
  uses, so the arithmetic underneath is `x25519.field` rather than a second
  copy of it. Only the curve is new.

  A point is `[X Y Z T]` with `x = X/Z`, `y = Y/Z` and `T = XY/Z`. The
  redundant fourth coordinate is what makes addition a fixed sequence of
  multiplications with no inversion and no branch on the inputs.

  ## The constants were derived

  `d = -121665/121666`, `sqrt(-1) = 2^((p-1)/4)`, and the base point's
  `y = 4/5` with `x` recovered from the curve equation and taken even. All
  four were computed with arbitrary precision and checked against the
  published values before being written here.

  ## Not constant-time

  The ladder swaps with `x25519.field`'s arithmetic mask, but timing is a
  property of machine code and no portable Clojure controls it. `ed25519.sign`
  says the same where a caller reads it."
