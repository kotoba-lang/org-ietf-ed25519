  Scalars are 32 little-endian bytes, and the reduction works on **byte
  limbs** rather than on a big integer: neither runtime has one both can
  name, and on byte limbs every intermediate stays under about 2^22, which is
  exact as a JVM long and as a JavaScript number alike.

  This is the shape TweetNaCl uses, for the same reason."
