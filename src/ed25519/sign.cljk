  "[RFC 8032](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032) Ed25519 signing and
  verification, in portable `.cljc`.

  `ed25519.core` — this library's older half — derives keys and encodes them,
  and reaches the platform's own signer through a reader conditional. That is
  fine where a platform signer exists and is nothing at all where one does
  not, which is most of what this workspace targets. Measured across the 193
  repositories declaring `@noble/curves`, the consumers call `sign` 193 times
  and `verify` 131; neither had a first-party implementation until now.

  ## Use

      (def sk (secret-key seed))          ; 32 random bytes in
      (:public sk)                        ; 32 bytes
      (def sig (sign sk message))         ; 64 bytes
      (verify (:public sk) message sig)   ; true / false

  Bytes are `Sequential` collections of ints in 0..255.

  ## What it is and is not

  **PureEd25519 only.** RFC 8032 also defines Ed25519ph (pre-hashed) and
  Ed25519ctx; both take a domain-separation prefix this does not build, and
  adding them without a consumer would ship two untested code paths that look
  interchangeable with this one and are not.

  **Signatures are deterministic**, which is the specification's design: the
  nonce comes from the private key and the message, so there is no randomness
  to get wrong and no ECDSA-style catastrophe from a repeated one.

  **`verify` rejects `S >= L`.** RFC 8032 §5.1.7 requires it, and without the
  check a signature can be mauled into a second valid one for the same
  message — which breaks anything treating a signature as an identifier.

  **Not constant-time.** Timing is a property of machine code and no portable
  Clojure controls it. Where a timing side channel is in scope, use the
  platform's Ed25519 and treat this as the reference it is checked against."
